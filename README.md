# Magic Square in C

This project is a C implementation of a **magic square** using the **Samoise method**. A magic square is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers, such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

## Description
A **magic square** of order `n` is an arrangement of numbers in an `n x n` grid where the sum of each row, each column, and both diagonals is equal. This project constructs a magic square of any odd order using the **Samoise method**.

The magic square generated by this program:
- Has a grid of size `n x n` (where `n` is an odd number).
- Ensures that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

## Samoise Method
The **Samoise method** follows these rules to construct a magic square:
1. Start with the number `1` placed in the middle of the top row.
2. Move to the cell diagonally above and to the right (up-right) of the current cell.
   - If the move takes you outside the grid, wrap around to the other side of the grid.
   - If the destination cell is already occupied, move down vertically instead.
3. Repeat the process until all numbers from `1` to `n^2` are placed in the grid.

## Code Explanation

### Functions Overview
- **`matrice_nulle(int **a, int n)`**: Initializes the `n x n` matrix by setting all elements to `0`.
- **`affiche(int **a, int n)`**: Displays the `n x n` matrix in a formatted way.
- **`free_(int **a, int n)`**: Frees the dynamically allocated memory for the matrix to avoid memory leaks.
- **`samoise(int **ar, int n)`**: Implements the **Samoise method** to fill the `n x n` matrix with a magic square.

### Detailed Function Explanations

1. **`matrice_nulle(int **a, int n)`**:
   This function initializes the `n x n` matrix with zeros. It uses two nested loops to iterate through each row and column, setting every element to `0`.

   ```c
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
           a[i][j] = 0;
       }
   }
